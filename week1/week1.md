# week1 (month0/week0)
Officially started work on Friday (09/06); was waiting for response from HR until then though the contract is supposed to start at 09/01.

What I did this week (actually, the past two days):
- Officially entered the testing group and received my quota of PVE infra. Introduced myself on this week's group meeting
- Continued maintenance work of [lintestor](), picking up my [previous work](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/pull/1) during the [pretask](../week0/testround.md):
  - Functional changes:
    - [rework logging output with env_logger](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/dd6bcd832ca66005206d515613cf02e5c3a18420)
    - [make prerequisite.sh optional; fix connection method display](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/e2ef1a728d6e7187284cb7be608982fa05cfb649)
  - Code cleanup:
    - [make clippy happy](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/3afae63ed25a7e49eedb0ad56aba934e35186bae)
  - Documentation:
    - Wrote a basic [Usage Guide](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/f79a6ac36375c7811e48cd951c4bfa090f83c8d8) for the tool, plus its corresponding [English version](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/8381c435c032437278aa793138c4cbee97479151).
  - Collaboration:
    - Discussed with @255doesnotexist about the project roadmap through the form of Issues in the repository (self-assigned to and closed [#13](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/issues/13) for example).
- Ordered a Milk-V Duo 256M board; still waiting for shipment as of writing.

## Future plans
Find a demo to work on once I got the Milk-V Duo board?

Will continue develop `lintestor` in the meantime.

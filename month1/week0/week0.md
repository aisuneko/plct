# month1/week0
What I did this week, during holiday:
## `lintestor` development
### New Features
- Implemented "All tests failed" indicator (marked by ‚ùå) in generated Markdown report ([commit](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/11236fb1c3c1a19f74ad98b58fd7825e00721ff7))
- Added a flag `--skip-successful` to skip all completed successful tests ([commit](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/f91085286b731514facb629cf33c189458ae0a9f))
### Bug fixes
- Fix `metadata.sh` being discovered as a test script ([commit](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/commit/ebac3079d1bc5de7f5adec475939a4dd004f9798))

### Collaboration
- Closed issue [#25](https://github.com/255doesnotexist/lintestor/issues/25)

## RuyiSDK support matrix
More proofreading: [merged pull request](https://github.com/KevinMX/support-matrix/pull/43)
- Add missing Milk-V Jupiter entry in support matrix
- Fix incorrect "Duo 256M" info in LicheeRV Nano's docs


## Future plans
- rewrite Markdown generation process (perhaps with a third-party crate) and implement skipping of designated tests in `lintestor`
